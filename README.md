    Why did you decide to learn Software Engineering
    03/14/2020 by Tanattha Thuenim

The main reason I would like to study Software Engineering because I want to get a professional job in the USA. 
I want to start a job in an IT career.  I graduated in an IT major and used to code in Thailand for a while. 
I had to stop because I came to the USA as an Aupair. When I finished the Aupair program, I knew that I wanted to 
study either Software Engineering or Data Science. But one of my friends who graduated from the Software Engineering 
program told me how good this program was. I checked out on the website and saw that was fit my need. More than that, 
when I started the Bootcamp prep, it brought my feeling about coding back and I am so happy working on it.

I never code Javascript, Ruby or do full-stack before. Everything is new and challenge me. I kept studying on the Bootcamp 
every day even when I was working full-time. I tried my best in every lab. I know that this program will give me an opportunity to find a good job and make my life better. I also know that this is going to give me a hard time but I am not looking for easy anyway.
